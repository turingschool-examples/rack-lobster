# Hacking Rack::Lobster

This is a sample Rack app using the built in `Rack::Lobster` class. The pupose is to be able to
experiment with the standard Rack interface. The final goal is to get additional text to display
in the browser by editing the contents of the `config.ru` file.

* Start your rack server: `rackup config.ru`
* Take a look at the comments and see if you can answer the questions. Note: the numbers DON'T go in order from top to bottom.
* You will need to restart your server whenever you want to see a change in the browser.
